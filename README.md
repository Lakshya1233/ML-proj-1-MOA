Title: Fruit Classification Using Machine Learning

Description:

In this project, we aim to develop a robust fruit classification system using various machine learning (ML) techniques. The dataset consists of features such as color, shape, weight, and texture, along with the corresponding labels for different types of fruits.




Approach:

We'll start by preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Next, we'll use outlier detection techniques to identify anomalies and ensure data quality. Following this, we'll perform feature engineering to extract meaningful insights. Then, we'll apply clustering algorithms to uncover underlying patterns. Moving on to classification, we'll train models using various supervised learning algorithms. To improve model performance, we'll explore ensemble learning techniques. Finally, we'll validate our models using cross-validation, ROC curves, and confusion matrices to ensure robustness and generalization.



Tech Stack:

- Programming Language: Python
- Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Outcome:

By the end of this project, we aim to develop a highly accurate and robust fruit classification system that can effectively identify different types of fruits based on their features. This system can have various applications in agriculture, food processing, and retail industries.
